## 📖 Overview
This repository explores implementing Differential Privacy (DP) techniques into Large Language Models (LLMs) using the **FastDP** and **FlashDP** libraries. The goal is to rigorously experiment with privacy-preserving machine learning while maintaining robust model performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- [**FastDP**](https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy): A fast differentially private machine learning library by AWS Labs.
- [**FlashDP**](https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp): An optimized framework for differentially private training.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the correct CUDA-enabled PyTorch environment set up before installing the specific privacy libraries.

### PyTorch & FastDP Setup
Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.6 support, followed by the `FastDP` library directly from the AWS Labs repository:

```bash
# Install PyTorch and TorchVision
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126)

# Install FastDP
pip install git+[https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy.git](https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy.git)

```

### FlashDP Setup
```bash

# Clone the repository and navigate into it
git clone [https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.git](https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.git)
cd flashdp

# Optional but recommended: Create and activate a new Conda environment
conda env create -f env.yml 
conda activate flashdp      

# Run the installation script
bash install.sh

```
